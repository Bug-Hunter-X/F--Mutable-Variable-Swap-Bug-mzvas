This repository demonstrates a common error in F# involving mutable variables and unexpected behavior when passing them to functions. The `bug.fs` file contains code that attempts to swap two mutable variables using a function, but fails due to pass-by-reference semantics. The `bugSolution.fs` file provides a corrected version that achieves the intended swapping using tuples or by returning new values.
